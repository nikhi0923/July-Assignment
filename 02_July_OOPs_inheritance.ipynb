    "Single inheritance refers to a type of inheritance relationship in object-oriented programming\n",
    "where a subclass (derived class) inherits from only one superclass (base class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of single inheritance:\n",
    "1.Simplicity: The class hierarchy is easier to understand since there is only one parent class to consider. This can lead to more manageable and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Avoiding Diamond Problem: The diamond problem is a potential issue that arises in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that have a common superclass. In single inheritance, this problem is avoided, as each class has only one parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Clear Hierarchy: Single inheritance often leads to a straightforward and intuitive hierarchy, making it easier to design and implement the relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Multiple inheritance is an inheritance model where a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple superclasses (base classes). A class can extend the functionality of multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance enables a class to inherit functionality from multiple sources, promoting efficient code reuse.\n",
    "Flexibility: It allows developers to model more complex relationships and mix different sets of behaviors from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "Richer Functionality: With multiple inheritance, a class can combine attributes and methods from different sources, resulting in a more feature-rich subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Parent Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: A class inherits from only one parent class.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: A class can inherit from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "Hierarchy Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: The hierarchy is linear, with each class having a single parent class.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: The hierarchy can become more complex, as a class can have multiple parent classes.\n",
    "Method and Attribute Resolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: Method and attribute resolution is generally straightforward, as there is only one source to consider.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: Method and attribute resolution can be more complex, especially when there are name conflicts between parent classes."
